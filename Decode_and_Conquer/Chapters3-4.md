## Chapter 3 Designing a Webpage or Website

This chapter discusses about the application of the **CIRCLES** framework introduced in the previous chapter.
It also provides sample interview scenarios on improving a webpage or website.

One tip in the chapter is **Interview Visually**. This is very important in a Product design or a critique of an exisiting design because showing the wireframes or 
images actually makes communication of the idea much easier. In most cases where we can show the visual design it makes the ensuing discussion also much easier.

The other tip,while its not applicable for other roles is to prepare some improvement ideas for the company you are interviewing and have the wireframes handy. 
This is a way to signal that you have done your homework and also comes in handy because there is enough certainity of a design or a redesign question in a Product management
interview.

The case studies themselves follow the application of the CIRCLES method without explicitly mentioning them. They start by asking some clarifying questions which corresponds
to Comprehend the Situation and then merge Identifying the customer and Reporting customer needs because in website design you kind of know the use cases from your clarifications.
The customer personas who use the website/ webpage and prioritizing them form the cutting through prioritization step.
Then listing solutions, evaluating options and summarizing solutions follow.


## Chaper 4 Designing a Mobile App

This chapter follows the same approach as chapter 3. 

The other key recommendation in the chapter was to intelligently incorporating Customer Insight. This is also showing the interviewer
your understanding of the business space.
