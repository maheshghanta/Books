One of the great things about frameworks is that they are excellent for structuring our thoughts. However, if we blindly go by them
sometimes we might lose an obvious solution and make our discussion very robotic.
This might not impress the interviewer because what they are trying to do is to make a conversation and understand how you approach the problem.

This is the tip provided in the chapter where we have to structure our thoughts but not be bound only by them.

Having said that the key skill of product management is to understand who your customer is, what they need and how can you provide it to them in a manner that is 
beneficial for both the parties.

So, **CIRCLES** without circles is the key takeaway. Segmenting your customers, identifying the needs of each segment and solving is the pattern to suggest.
However, communication is an equally important skill and hence practicing different interviewing styles is the key approach to aceing your Product management interview.

Another key tip provided in this chapter is around researching a lot about the company and team you are interviewing for. Because, the interviewers are talking to 
multiple people the key is to standout. This preparation will help you structure you answers in a much crisper fashion. Also, it would avoid bloopers like providing 
a product or a feature that the company already has or tried. This is very essential because these are the key differentiators when convincing a hire/ no hire decision.

Technology is a vast field that is effervescent. Hence, we will not be able to keep up with all the trends. However, researching all the trends related to the company, specifically
the team we are interviewing for, will phenomenally improve the performance at the interview. It also make the conversation and discusssion easier because the interviewer
needs to spend less time explaining a produce feature to you.
